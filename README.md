# CppMultiMethods
C++17 Open Multi-Methods

This is a header-only library for open Multi-Methods in C++. The library only compiles with C++17 (tested with VS2017 and clang).
The example.cpp shows two examples of usage. It provides a lot of flexibility.
You neither need any virtual "acceptMyVisitor"-function nor a macro.
